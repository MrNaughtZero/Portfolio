                        <p id="about-me-text">
                            I love coding!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I'm a 23 year old Web Developer, from Liverpool - United Kingdom. It's fair to say I'm an absolute tech nerd :-). I'm the guy everyone seems to have on speed dial for when something goes wrong - which I don't mind. I'm always up for a challenge, and I love learning new skills - who doesn't?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My very first experience with computers, that has always stuck in my mind - was when I was around 10 years old in primary school. A friend of mine went on a <b>very naughty website</b>, which I shall not name, and let's just say I took the blame for said offence. Couple of hours later, the school was on the phone to my Dad, and I would soon be banned from computers for a year. 
                            <Br>
                            <br>
                            I think not being allowed to go on the computer, made me want to go on them more. I remember waking up early hours in the morning, whilst everyone was sleeping, and playing games on Miniclip!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            And here I am today, no longer banned, spending the majority of my time learning to code, repairing other PC's, and helping friends with their problems. Not just PC's though, I also have experience repairing Televisions, Mobiles, iPads/Tablets & more. I like learning new stuff, but the stories about repairs is for another time.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Whilst I may seem like a typical nerd, I am very socialable guy, who has a lot of hobbies. Just you try and keep me out the pub! Apart from the pub, I also really enjoy ice-skating - even if I am <b>"absolutely shocking"</b> - Not my words, but my girlfriends!!

                                <b>WordPress</b> - CBDVapeRus was the first CBD vape shop to launch online in Liverpool. First launched over 2 years ago, this was my first hands on approach with building a website. Built for my friend, I soon after realised I enjoyed creating Websites.

                                <b>WordPress</b> - Jay, from SneakerShields first contacted me when he realised his site was going really slow, and it was driving customers away. He wanted the exact same theme, but he wanted it recreated from scratch, as he believed a lot of it was outdated, and needed redoing. It was rebuit with Bootstrap.
